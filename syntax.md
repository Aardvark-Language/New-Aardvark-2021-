if "hi"="hi" {

output("Test") //Outputs Test\\

class MyClass {
  ~id {
    //identifier method\\
  }
  ~ref {
    //Method called when the var is referenced\\
  }
  ~init(arg1) {
    this.arg1=arg1
  }
  funct method1(){
    //method\\
  }
}
x=3
x=2x //x is now equal to 6\\
equ: 6+x = 7*7 // The equation system is very complicated, Ill explain it later\\
// A number before a variable means they are multiplied just like in math\\
//There is a ton more stuff that I have not shown you\\
funct myfunct(arg1, arg2) {
  //function\\
}
//understand that?\\
continue will continue the code after it as a background process
await is like python await, I am still working this output
#include includes stuff . used in place of / in the path
//I think I told the main things\\
